	Currently a stub header. Intended to eventually replace assertions that may fail as a result
	of lua scripts/XML scripts doing nasty stuff.
	
	GameWorldException will bring the game itself to a halt and provide an error message to the player,
	while not terminating the application. 
	
	Will probably also have code for more informative error reporting.
